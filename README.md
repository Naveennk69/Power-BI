üåæ District-Level Agricultural Analysis ‚Äì Power BI Project Report
1. Project Title:
District-Level Agricultural Performance Analytics Using Power BI
________________________________________
2. Executive Summary:
This Power BI project aims to analyze district-level agricultural data to identify production trends, crop performance, irrigation coverage, and regional disparities in farming practices across Indian districts. The dashboard provides policymakers and researchers with a comprehensive view to support data-driven decisions for sustainable agriculture.

3. Objectives:
‚Ä¢	Analyze crop-wise and district-wise production trends.
‚Ä¢	Identify high and low-performing agricultural districts.
‚Ä¢	Study irrigation coverage and land use patterns.
‚Ä¢	Provide actionable insights for agricultural planning and resource allocation.

4. Dataset Description:
‚Ä¢	Source: ICRISAT District-Level Dataset
‚Ä¢	Records: Multi-year panel data for Indian districts
‚Ä¢	Key Fields:
o	State, District
o	Year, Season
o	Crop, Area Sown, Production, Yield
o	Irrigated Area, Rainfall, Fertilizer Use, Population
________________________________________
5. Data Preparation & Modeling:
‚Ä¢	Cleaned missing and inconsistent values using Power Query.
‚Ä¢	Created a star schema with:
o	Fact Table: Crop Production Data
o	Dimension Tables: Districts, Crops, Time, Weather
‚Ä¢	Created DAX measures including:
o	Total Production
o	Average Yield
o	Irrigation Ratio = Irrigated Area / Total Area
o	Fertilizer Usage per Hectare

‚Ä¢	KPI indicators: Total Production, Avg. Yield, Irrigated Area %
üó∫Ô∏è District-Level Map Visualization
‚Ä¢	Choropleth map of India displaying:
o	Yield per hectare
o	Irrigation coverage
o	Fertilizer usage intensity
ü•¶ Crop Comparison
‚Ä¢	Bar charts showing top crops by production and yield
‚Ä¢	Multi-year performance trend lines
üå¶Ô∏è Weather Impact Analysis
‚Ä¢	Rainfall vs. Yield scatter plot
‚Ä¢	Conditional formatting to show years of low rainfall and low yield

7. Key Insights:
‚Ä¢	Yield Variability: Districts in southern India tend to have more stable yields over time.
‚Ä¢	Irrigation Gaps: Some high-yield districts still rely on rainfed agriculture.
‚Ä¢	Crop Performance: Rice and Wheat dominate production, but Maize and Pulses show promising yield increases.
‚Ä¢	Rainfall Dependency: Certain crops exhibit strong yield sensitivity to rainfall fluctuations.
‚Ä¢	Fertilizer Impact: Overuse of fertilizers is not strongly correlated with higher yields in all cases‚Äîoptimal usage matters.

8. Recommendations:
1.	Target Irrigation Investment in high-potential but low-irrigated districts.
2.	Promote Climate-Resilient Crops in rainfall-dependent areas.
3.	Focus on Balanced Fertilizer Use to optimize input cost vs. yield.
4.	Use Yield Data for Crop Diversification Planning in mono-crop districts.
5.	Deploy Agricultural Extension Programs in low-yield but high-resource districts.
